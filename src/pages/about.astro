                    <p class="mb-4">Upon finding myself in need of professional lawn care at my home, I obtained a few quotes. What made Will, owner/operator of Edwards Lean Care, stand out from the others was his professionalism, prompt responses, fair pricing, obvious hard work ethic and thoughtful follow up communication. In other words, everything that can make a business successful. It is truly refreshing to find a business built on such principles among many these days that have abandoned them. I wholeheartedly recommend Edwards Landscape Group to anyone in need of these services.</p>
