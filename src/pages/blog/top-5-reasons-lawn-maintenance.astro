                You already know mowing matters, but the timing, height, and cleanup after each visit determine how well your
                lawn handles heat, drought, and heavy foot traffic. Edwards Landscape Group crews follow agronomic best practices
                that mirror the TruGreen approach you see nationwide, adapted for Lynchburg's weather and soil.
              </p>

              <h2 id="health">1. Health benefits that start at the roots</h2>
              <p>
                Proper cutting height changes with the season. We adjust blades to keep more leaf surface during summer and lower
                the deck slightly in spring and fall to stimulate new growth. Paired with sharp blades and alternating mowing
                patterns, this keeps roots deeper and less prone to disease.
              </p>
              <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Sharp blades that prevent frayed leaf tips and brown edges.</li>
                <li>Pattern rotation that reduces ruts and soil compaction.</li>
                <li>Clippings mulched to return nutrients without smothering turf.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="appearance">2. Curb appeal that stays consistent</h2>
              <p>
                Weekly edging around beds, walks, and driveways keeps lines crisp. We finish each visit with debris cleanup so
                mulch color, paver joints, and driveway edges look fresh—just like the clean visuals in TruGreen's service photos.
              </p>

              <h2 id="time">3. Time savings for busy weeks</h2>
              <p>
                You get a predictable route schedule and text reminders before arrival. Crews handle trimming, blowing, and gate
                security, so you can plan weekends without the chore list.

              </ul>

              <h2 id="seasonal">4. Seasonal protection that prevents setbacks</h2>
              <p>
                Transition seasons are when turf is most vulnerable. Aeration and overseeding in early fall, paired with proper
                mowing height, set roots before winter. In spring, a cleanup visit removes salt, sticks, and thatch so new blades
                emerge evenly.

              <p>
                A uniform lawn boosts first impressions for guests and buyers. Routine maintenance also catches issues early—like
                fungus rings or irrigation problems—so we can loop in fertilization or tree and shrub care before damage spreads.
