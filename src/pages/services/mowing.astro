        <h2 class="mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="service-accordion">
          <details open>
            <summary>How often should my lawn be mowed?</summary>
            <p>
            Most lawns do best with weekly mowing during peak growth. During slower growth, bi-weekly service may be enough.
            We can recommend a schedule based on your grass type, shade, and how you want it to look.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you bag clippings or mulch them?</summary>
            <p>
            In many cases we mulch clippings because it returns nutrients to the soil. If your lawn is overgrown or you prefer bagging,
            we can discuss options based on your property and the time of year.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Will mowing help with weeds?</summary>
            <p>
            Consistent mowing helps keep your lawn thicker and healthier, which can reduce space for weeds to establish.
            Weed issues may still require targeted treatment depending on the type and severity.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you mow in the rain?</summary>
            <p>
            We avoid mowing saturated lawns to prevent ruts and turf damage. If weather delays service, we’ll return as soon as conditions allow.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How short do you cut the grass?</summary>
            <p>
            We aim for a healthy height based on the season. Cutting too short can stress the lawn, cause yellowing, and invite weeds.
            We adjust height to support long-term health and appearance.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can you mow around landscaping, playsets, and obstacles?</summary>
            <p>
            Yes. We mow carefully around beds, trees, playsets, and common obstacles. If an area requires special handling, let us know during the quote.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer one-time mowing?</summary>
            <p>
            Yes, one-time mowing may be available depending on schedule and property conditions. Most customers choose recurring service for the best results.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Will you edge every visit?</summary>
            <p>
            Edging is commonly included to keep the lawn looking crisp. Exact frequency can depend on growth and the service plan you choose.
