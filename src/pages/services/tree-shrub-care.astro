        <h2 class="mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="service-accordion">
          <details open>
            <summary>How often should shrubs be trimmed?</summary>
            <p>
            Many shrubs do well with seasonal trimming. Fast-growing hedges may need more frequent shaping.
            We’ll recommend a schedule based on your plants and how neat you want them to look.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Will trimming reduce flowering?</summary>
            <p>
            Some flowering shrubs need trimming at specific times to protect blooms. We’ll adjust timing and technique to support healthy flowering when possible.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can you trim around windows, walkways, and driveways?</summary>
            <p>
            Yes. Keeping plants cleared away from high-traffic and visibility areas is a common goal and improves both appearance and safety.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you remove the clippings?</summary>
            <p>Yes. Cleanup can be included as part of the service depending on volume and the plan you choose.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you handle small trees?</summary>
            <p>Yes. We can trim and shape small ornamental trees and discuss larger trees if needed.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What if shrubs are severely overgrown?</summary>
            <p>
            If shrubs are heavily overgrown, we may recommend a more significant cutback and then ongoing maintenance to keep them under control.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can trimming improve plant health?</summary>
            <p>
            Yes. Removing dead or damaged growth and improving airflow can help reduce stress and improve long-term health.
